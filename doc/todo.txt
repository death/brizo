1. separate member function definitions from declaration in templates
2. separate into _impl.h files
3. put detail in detail directory, exhaustion policies in exhaustion
   directory
4. consider calling instruction::add_register_v, add_direct_address_32_v,
   etc. instead of creating using new - no need for visitor, _v hierarchy,
   shared_ptr, formatter (maybe), etc.
5. think about moving comments after #ifdef guard

Decode values
Instruction classification
Format instructions
Verify operands with new Intel specs
